    question: 'What comes first: Customer Experience or Employee Experience?',
    answer: `The link between employee experience and customer experience has always been a very strong one. People love to come up with the example of Amazon when this subject is discussed, claiming something like “Amazon may have happy clients, but so many of their employees are unhappy”. You can have happy clients and unhappy employees. That can unfortunately happen. But it is an exception. There is a very strong correlation between happy employees and happy clients. When you have happy employees, it’s almost certain that you will breed happy customers.`,

    question:
      'How can you make sure that everyone is involved in delivering a great customer experience?',
    answer: `If you want to create a culture that is completely focused on creating a great customer experience, you have to realize that every employee plays a vital role there. Don’t make the mistake of putting a small group of elite people in charge of the customer. Organizations need to invest in involving the entire company in putting the customer first. For instance, co-create a vision with them and let them come up with solutions and ideas to increase the customer experience.`,

    question: 'Digital is great, but can we go all the way? How about privacy?',
    answer: `The issue of privacy only seems to be growing in importance: “can we do all the things that we want to do in customer experience under this strict privacy legislation”? The problem is that we too often begin this discussion by zooming in on the legislation. That’s the wrong starting point because you’ll always keep yourself in the gray zone. You’ll always try to optimize your value within the limits of the legislation. Start from a different point. Instead of worrying about privacy, worry about customer value. Ask yourself “how can we create the best possible customer value?”. And only then zoom in on the second question: “what kind of data do we need for that”?`,

    question:
      'How can we make our customer experience more unique and not just seamless?',
    answer: `Many people believe that in the end customer experience will be the same in every organization and that the world will be totally grey and boring because we’re all doing the same thing. I totally disagree. That would mean that customer experience is only about optimizing processes. I think that’s just the bottom of the story. What you need to do is of course, install the processes to make sure you have a fluent service, but the difference is not made with these processes. The difference is made with your own identity. It’s made by your own culture. `,

    question: 'What is the best way to measure the impact of CX?',
    answer: `There’s always a lot of debate about how best to measure customer experience. That you need to measure it, is obvious. But to be honest, “how to measure it” seems not the most relevant question. You could work with NPS or customer satisfaction. That’s all fine. The really crucial question, though, is “what do you do with that information”? How do you translate that back to into your organization? Is it just a PowerPoint that you discuss with the board? Or do you drill it down to make sure that everyone in the organization knows about the feedback of your customers?`,
